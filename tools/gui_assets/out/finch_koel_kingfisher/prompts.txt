REFERENCE IMAGE PROVIDED: Use the attached finch base as the fixed coordinate frame.
Task: generate a canvas layer ONLY for Eye = Mask.
Placement: keep the changed pixels positioned exactly where they belong on the reference bird. Do not move them, do not center them, do not zoom.
Background handling: every pixel NOT part of the intended Eye layer must remain solid chroma key #FF00FF (no partial transparency). Do not draw faint outlines/ghosting of the rest of the bird.


notes: Must align to base; use inpainting/reference image.
