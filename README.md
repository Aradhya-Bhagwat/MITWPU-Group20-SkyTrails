### 🤝 Contribution Guidelines (Internal Team)

To ensure smooth collaboration:

1.  **Branching Strategy:** Use **Git Flow** (or a simplified version): `main` for production-ready code, `develop` for integration, and `feature/name-of-feature` for all new work.
2.  **Commit Messages:** Use clear, descriptive commit messages (e.g., `FEAT: Implemented sighting log view` or `FIX: Resolved map annotation bug`).
3.  **Code Review:** All merges into `develop` or `main` require a successful **Pull Request** review from at least one other team member.
4.  **Issue Tracker:** Check the GitHub Issues tab for assigned tasks and priorities before starting new work.
